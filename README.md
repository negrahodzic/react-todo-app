To-do app

You are required to build a "Todo List" application using React. The application should allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks and subtasks. Every task can contain subtasks and every subtask can contain its own subtasks...(this feature should allow creating an infinite subtasks structure). The application should also have a feature to mark a task or a subtask as completed. When a task is marked as completed, it should move to the Completed tasks list. When all subtasks are marked as completed, their parent should automatically change its status to Completed.
